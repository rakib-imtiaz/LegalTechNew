2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
NomosAI will be a web-based platform that integrates multiple AI systems. It will include frontend (React-based UI), backend services (Node.js/Python), secure cloud storage, and third-party APIs for transcription, legal database access (e.g., court opinions, public database), and video/audio recordings. NomosAI is a modular, web-based AI platform, integrating:
LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini)


Cloud storage (AWS/GCP)


Speech-to-text APIs


Legal data APIs (Lexis, Westlaw, Caselaw Access Project)


Audio/Video analysis and recording tools
2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
Lawyers and Law Firms: Require fast, accurate legal research, drafting, and case evaluation.
Clients: Seek to explain their case, get instant feedback, and connect with lawyers.
Admins: Maintain and monitor the system.
2.3 Assumptions and Dependencies
Internet connectivity is essential.
Third-party APIs like legal databases, AI transcription, and language models will be integrated.
User data will be stored securely and encrypted. And the users can delete their data anytime.
